# Request Crawler

For some Websites it seems to be easier to write a crawler without using Scrapy.

## News
- Cointelegraph - Spider
- Ripplecoin News - Spider (not used but works)

## Timeseries
- cryptowat.ch API
- bitfinex API (not used, because it can be accessed through cryptowat.ch)
- ecbscraper API (not used, only needed in real-time system)
